# Big Five Personality Prediction

This project allows users to train and evaluate a model to predict Big Five personality traits from text data using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Features

- Preprocesses data for training
- Trains a multi-label regression model
- Evaluates model performance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone your-private-repository-url.git
   cd big5_personality_prediction
```

2. Install the required packages:
``bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory with your dataset URL:
```bash
DATA_URL=path/to/your/dataset.json
```


#Usage

##   Preprocess Data:
    
Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and update the DATA_URL in config.py.

 ```  
bash
python utils/preprocess.py
```

##  Train Model:

Train the model using the preprocessed data.
```
bash

python utils/train.py
```
##Evaluate Model:

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.
```
bash

python utils/evaluate.py
```

#Configuration

Update config.py with the appropriate settings for your dataset and training parameters.

## Initialization Files

To ensure that Python treats the `models` and `utils` directories as packages, add `__init__.py` files:

```
 `models/__init__.py`

```python

# This file is intentionally left blank to indicate that this directory is a Python package.

utils/__init__.py

python

# This file is intentionally left blank to indicate that this directory is a Python package.

#This structure and the simplified code should help you set up and run your project locally without exposing your code to the public.
# The model is available at: https://huggingface.co/KevSun/Personality_LM
